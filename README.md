# ProgrammingAssignment-2
set the value of m to NULL (provides a default if cacheSolve has not yet been used)
cache the inputted matrix so that cacheSolve can check whether it has changed (note this is within the setmatrix function)
setting the value of m (the matrix inverse if used cacheSolve) to NULL
if an inverse has already been calculated getmatrix() gets it
!is.null(mat) check to see if cacheSolve has been run before
compute the value of the inverse of the input matrix
mat returns inverse
